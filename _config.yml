# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  শুধু বিনোদনের জন্য প্রথম আলুর জন্ম। এই সাইটের কোনো নিউজের সাথে বাস্তবতার কোনো মিল নেই। কোনো প্রতিবেদনের সাথে বাস্তবতা মিলে গেলে তা নেহাতই কাকতালীয়।

# Site configuration for the Jekyll 3 Pagination Gem
# The values here represent the defaults if nothing is set
# Due to us using the categories for posts then it is advisable to explicitly specify a
# permalink structure for the site. Otherwise Jekyll attempts to organize the pages in folders
# by the category names and it doesn't understand multi-categories to well :/
